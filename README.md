## Description of the application
### Purpose
This is a terminal-based application written in Ruby language with the purpose of being a "fun" and interactive game. Players compete each other on answering questions/challenges that are randomly generated on the theme of Rick and Morty. Each game has a winner, where points are accumulated for correct answers, with speed being another factor in determining the winner. 

### Functionality
Terminal-based application means the functions are limited to the actions of displaying and input of data. App functions as a CLI (Command Line Interface) and not a GUI (Graphical User Interface). This implies executing command lines is how we interact with the operating system with the utilization of only a keyboard (no use of mouse). 

The application works in a simple manner where questions are prompted and the user will enter back a single answer. 
(no need to write sentences) 

### Instructions for use
Questions will be asked and the application will wait until a user gives a single answer before proceeding to the next step. It will prompt if you have answered the question incorrect/correctly.  
e.g. 
```
How many vowels are in Rick Sanchez?
> 3
correct
```

### Project Plan & Timeline
#### Day 1.
Brainstorm application ideas and discuss and decide the best idea, i.e. simple to implement, but also can utilize our learnings of classes.

Finish pseudo code, requirements for MVP (Minimal Viable Product), extra features and hash down method ideas to utilize for the game
#### Day 2.
Following the pseudo code, start pair programming and be able to produce a MVP at the end of the day.

#### Day 3. 
Add extra features on the application, making cosmetic changes, implementing more gems and plan presentation.
