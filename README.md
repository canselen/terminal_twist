##Description of the application
###Purpose
This is a terminal-based application written in Ruby language with the purpose of being a "fun" and interactive game. Players compete each other on answering questions/challenges that are randomly generated on the theme of Rick and Morty. Each game has a winner, where points are accumulated for correct answers, with speed being another factor in determining the winner. 

###Functionality
Terminal-based application means the functions are limited to the actions of displaying and input of data. App functions as a CLI (Command Line Interface) and not a GUI (Graphical User Interface). This implies executing command lines is how we interact with the operating system with the utilization of only a keyboard (no use of mouse). 

The application works in a simple manner where questions are prompted and the user will enter back a single answer. 
(no need to write sentences) 

###Instructions for use
Questions will be asked and the application will wait until a user gives a single answer before proceeding to the next step. It will prompt if you have answered the question incorrect/correctly.  
e.g. 
```
How many vowels are in Rick Sanchez?
> 3
correct
```
